// package murmur3 implements the Murmur3 hash function by Austin Appleby
// referenced from https://code.google.com/p/smhasher/source/browse/trunk/MurmurHash3.h.
// It's much faster than the standard library's hashing functions but slightly
// slower than my xxhash package at https://github.com/asadmshah/xxhash.
